C++ Tokenizer (Lexical Analyzer using Flex)

This project demonstrates the creation of a Lexical Analyzer for the C++ programming language using Flex. The analyzer processes input .cpp files and classifies contents into various tokens including keywords, identifiers, operators, constants, and more.

Features

🔑 Keyword recognition (int, float, return, etc.)

📛 Identifier and literal detection

➕ Operator parsing (arithmetic, logical, bitwise, etc.)

🔣 Punctuation and delimiter handling

📝 Comment support: single-line and multi-line

🔎 Outputs token type, value, and line number

Technologies Used

Flex (Fast lexical analyzer generator)

C++ (for input files and token definitions)

Collaboration

The project was completed in a two-member team. Responsibilities were divided between pattern development, regex formulation, and test case validation.
